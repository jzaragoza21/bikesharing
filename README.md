## Overview of Analysis

The objective of this project was to provide a Tableau presentation and proposal for investors to support a bike rideshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. In doing so, we did the following deliverables:

    - First, we were required to use Pandas to convert trip duration to a datetime format. 
    - Secondly, we create visualizations in Tableau for the trip analysis and see the relationship between gender, usertype and bike usage. This includes length of time bikes are checked out for all users and genders; the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week; and number of bike trips for each usertype and gender for each day of the week.
    - Thirdly, we finalize the Tableau presentation with stories and insights for each worksheet visualization.
