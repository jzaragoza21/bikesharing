Click here for my NYC Citibike Rideshare Analysis: [Tableau Story Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/josh.zaragoza/viz/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16416638545800/NYCCitibikeAnalysis)

## Overview of Analysis

The objective of this project was to provide a Tableau presentation and proposal for investors to support a bike rideshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. In doing so, we did the following deliverables:

    - First, we were required to use Pandas to convert trip duration to a datetime format. 
    - Secondly, we create visualizations in Tableau for the trip analysis and see the relationship between gender, usertype and bike usage. This includes length of time bikes are checked out for all users and genders; the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week; and number of bike trips for each usertype and gender for each day of the week.
    - Thirdly, we finalize the Tableau presentation with stories and insights for each worksheet visualization.

## Summary

According to the visualizations and anlysis, we can deduce that most users are residents of NYC and not tourists. In addition to this, we concluded that a majority of riders are males that use these bikes most frequently for travel to and from work with the peak usage being between 8am and 9am and 5pm to 7pm. Having said that, it shows that these bike rideshares are used more as transportation from work to home or whereever their destination is after work with 5pm to 7pm having much more usgae than morning peak hours. This is all beneficial for any upcoming marketing campaigns or launches in new markets. This analysis also showed that the common trip duration is 5 minutes with trips rarely going over 22 minutes and trips almost never going over 45 minutes. While NYC is much larger than Des Moines geographically, Des Moines is largely spread out like one large suburban market with a marginal city center. Therefore, I would recommend we do some more anlysis and visualizations around distance between stations and how this new market would impact trip duration.
